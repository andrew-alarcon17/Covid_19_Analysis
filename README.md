# Covid_19_Analysis

## Background
As of March 26th, 2020, the purpose of this notebook is to understand the growth rate of the Covid-19 virus in China and the U.S, and how they differ. Information is also extracted from the data about the countries that have been mostly impacted with confirmed cases of the virus.

Politics aside, let's say the numbers for confirmed cases of the virus coming from China are true. We can clearly see that the U.S. had a huge spike in confirmed cases in a very short amount of time, surpassing China easily.

Here we see that the U.S. is on course to having much more deaths (and if  you are seeing this project post April/May, you know that the present day death toll is huge).

Considering there was no cure for the virus at this time, it would make sense that the global recovery rate is much lower than the amount of confirmed cases.

## Conclusion

Based on the visualizations above, you can clearly see that the U.S. is on course to becoming a majorly affected country by the virus in the entire world. The confirmed cases are already number 1 in the world, and the death toll will only continue to rise.
